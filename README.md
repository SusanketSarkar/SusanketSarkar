### Hi, I'm Susanket 👋

I'm a data scientist with a strong tilt toward building real-world, ML-powered products.  
Currently at **Aereo**, working on AI in the geospatial space 🌍🛰️.

💡 **What I'm exploring right now:**
- Reinforcement Learning fundamentals and applications 🧠
- Building an AI-powered **smartphone app** that converts ebooks to audiobooks using generative voice models 📱📖🔊
- Contributing to [**Hex**](https://hex.tech/), exploring how notebooks can go beyond analysis and become full-stack data products 📊🧩

🛠️ I enjoy:
- Applied ML research → productization
- Training & fine-tuning models across vision, language, and speech
- Reading about behavioral psychology, learning systems, and tech+society intersections

Always up for learning new things, collaborating on good ideas, and experimenting with side projects.

Let’s connect, code, and build useful things 🚀
